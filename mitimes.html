            <p class="pb-4"> <a class="hover:text-pink-lighter underline" href="https://mitimes.com/">Mitimes</a> is a time keeping application made by lawyers, for lawyers, with the aim of simplifying
              the painful process of timekeeping for legal professionals. I was involved in this project
              as part of a small team of 3 to handle the rebranding, UI and UX and front end development of version 3 of the app.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">The conceptual approach to the branding was to move away from the “error red”
              colours and alarm clock iconography that had made up previous versions of the app, and instead focus on a positive
              approach to time. The aim of the redesign was not only to make the app easier to use, but to relieve the user of
              pressure and make them feel like they have more time. As such the company logo was changed from a ticking timer to a
              graphical representation of a smooth flowing pendulum.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4"> My role in the project involved the conceptualization and creation of all the key branding elements,
              including logo, typography, colours and iconography. As as well this I managed the design and prototyping of the user
              interface. As a team we would have discussion on issues facing the users and how new features could solve these problems,
              which I would then design and prototype into to screens for user testing. Once final designs were realised, we as a team
              would collaborate with the Mitimes development team to implement the features and layout into the app.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4"> Upon launch the new version of the app has proved successful, with adoption amoungst new law firms,
              and greater user confidence in automated timekeeping.
            </p>
